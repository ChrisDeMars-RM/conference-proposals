When we think of CSS and Accessibility, what comes to mind? Is it adding alt attributes to image tags? How about color contrast for low vision users? Is :focus given that much thought since browser's style these by default? We can't remove outlines without replacing them with something. As web interactions become more accessible, we must do our part in building awesome, accessible user experiences.

There are numerous ways to style the :focus class that I will demo in this talk as well as showcasing the default styles that the different browsers render and the problems with not setting :focus styles when using a reset.
