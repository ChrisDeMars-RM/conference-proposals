# Developing Large Scale Enterprise Applications.
As a developer working in an enterprise environment, maintaining a solid code base and steady pace of development without having to go back and change the code every time a new design of the same feature comes down the wire gets pretty frustrating. If you are scratching your head wondering if there is a solution to stop the headaches and frustrations of a waterfall methodology, within an enterprise? The answer is yes, three words sum it up, and those are, iterative driven development. This talk will focus on iterative driven development over incremental development, the differences between the two, how it is best used in large teams working on the same application, and how to not go crazy in the process.
