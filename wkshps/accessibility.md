# Accessibility Workshop

Accessibility on the web is increasing in visibility, yet some key influencers that are building on the web are still unfamiliar with how to create an amazing, accessible user experience. Spoiler alert, it starts with design, but what happens after that? In this workshop, I will walk the attendees through a site that has multiple violations,and a low score in Lighthouse. I will also touch on aXe Core, what it is, and how to use it to. After we comb through the experience, I will guide the attendees on a journey to re-engineer the site to be accessible by introducing easy wins like semantic markup, alt attributes, and ARIA labels to remove all violations.
