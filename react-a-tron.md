Still skeptical? If you use Slack, Atom, or VS Code, you are using Electron. When you pair Electron with React, you can build amazingly fast and robust applications for Windows, Mac, and Linux. In this session, we will walk through how to set up an application using Electron, than we will introduce React and build a small desktop app that looks and feels like a native desktop application.
