# Hacking the Human perception

## Description
Hacking you say? Yes, I do, but this type of hacking has nothing to do with hooking in Matrix style or surfing through The Gibson at Ellingson Mineral Company to stop the Da Vinci virus from capsizing oil tankers. Nope, this type of hacking involves how we as developers, create the illusion of fast load times for our Web applications. Performance is gaining much visibility in the industry and catering to the needs of the user, there are many things we can do to facilitate that need. This talk will focus on ways we can make things appear to be faster than they are and ways to avoid having to play Houdini entirely.
