## I Can't See: Low Vision A11Y & Users. 

### Abstract

When you think of low vision, what comes to mind? A user that is near sighted? How about far sighted? Maybe partially blind? These are all qualifying cases of poor vision, but low vision is more complicated than the prescription of glasses or contacts. 

According to the World Health Organization, they categorize low vision based on specifc levels of visual acuity and field of vision (W3.org, 2016). With that in mind, we as developers can look at diferent categories of low vision including color vision, visual acuity, contrast sensitivty, etc and make an effort to bake in things like zoom, non-conflicting colors, and rewrapping of columns in to our code.

My talk will cover what vision accessibility is, diferent categories of low vision, what the needs of the users are, and what we as developers can do to achieve a great user experience for low vision users.
