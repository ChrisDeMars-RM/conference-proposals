## Gulping All the Things.

### Abstract
Lost in the forest of front-end build systems out there? Check out Gulp! Gulp makes it super easy to minify, concatenate, and optimize your assets in an easy piping build stream. There are only a few commands to learn, so writing complex tasks (like you would in another system) isn't a thing in Gulp. In this talk, I will walk through what Gulp is and create a working gulpfile that can be used across endless front end projects that minifies, concatenates, and optimizes assets, as well as live reloads the browser using browser-sync.
