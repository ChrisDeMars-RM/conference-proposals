# Block__Element--Magic: CSS Modularity for the Enterprise.
Have you ever been faced with a code base that has been touched by a dozen or more developers all writing code, and as much as you want it to be modular it just isn't?

This talk will focus on basic BEM CSS architecture and how it can be the solution  towards modularity within an enterprise environment.
